<h2>The game is an endless runner, where we have a character who can run, jump over obstacles, or slide under them (although we currently don’t have obstacles that require rolling). The goal of the game is to beat the high score and collect coins to unlock different options (new skins, different levels). In terms of power-ups, collecting coffee increases the character’s speed, collecting diamonds adds 50 coins, and collecting a bomb deducts 50 coins.

The game levels are arranged by difficulty: City is the starting scene with easier difficulty, and Forest is the second scene, which can only be unlocked after collecting a certain number of coins and spending them to access that level.

In both City and Forest, the player follows a straight path and can move left and right using the arrow-left and arrow-right keys. The space key is used to jump, and the arrow-down key is used for rolling.</h2>
